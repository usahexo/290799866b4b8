        <h1 id="Maryland-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Allow-Sports-Playing-Reunion"><a href="#Maryland-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Allow-Sports-Playing-Reunion" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Becomes Latest State to Allow Sports Playing Reunion"></a>Maryland Becomes Latest State to Allow Sports Playing Reunion</h1><p>Just in time for college basketball season, Maryland has made it easier for former college athletes to reunite and play pickup games. Governor Larry Hogan signed the “Reuniting Athlete Play” bill into law on October 9, 2019. The new law allows any individual who played a sport at a University of Maryland campus to gather and play without having to worry about liability.</p>
<p>The new law will undoubtedly help boost the local economy, as many former college athletes will flock to the area to take advantage of the opportunity to play with friends and classmates. Hogan was quoted as saying, “This new law is great news for all of Maryland’s sports fans and players, and I’m glad we were able to pass it before the start of another great college basketball season.”</p>
<p>Sponsored by Delegate Dana Stein (D-Baltimore County), the bill had strong bipartisan support in both chambers of the Maryland legislature. “This legislation is commonsense and long overdue,” said Stein. “Allowing our alumni to come home and play together will not only be fun, but also could generate some much needed economic activity.”</p>
<p>Governor Hogan also cited the positive economic impact that legalized gambling has had in other states. “As we continue our efforts to make Maryland more friendly for business, it’s important that we also attract tourists who want to come here and enjoy our world-class amenities,” he said. “Allowing people to gather and play their favorite sports is a great way to do that.”</p>
<p>The new law will go into effect on November 1, 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Ohio-Allows-Sports-Playing-Reunion-Joining-24-Other-States"><a href="#Ohio-Allows-Sports-Playing-Reunion-Joining-24-Other-States" class="headerlink" title="Ohio Allows Sports Playing Reunion, Joining 24 Other States"></a>Ohio Allows Sports Playing Reunion, Joining 24 Other States</h1><p>Ohio has legalized sports playing reunion days, joining 24 other states that have already enacted similar bills. The legislation, which was signed into law by Governor John Kasich last week, allows companies to host events where employees can competitively play sports against each other.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure argue that it will help promote team building and camaraderie within businesses. Critics say that it could lead to more serious injuries, but proponents dispute this claim. “There are plenty of protections in place to ensure that people are safe when they’re playing sports,” said one state senator who sponsored the bill.</p>
<p>Governor Kasich himself is a fan of the legislation. “This is just a common sense thing,” he said in a statement. “It’s going to make Ohio businesses more competitive and create a fun environment for employees.”</p>
<h1 id="Massachusetts-Now-Allows-Sports-Playing-Reunion"><a href="#Massachusetts-Now-Allows-Sports-Playing-Reunion" class="headerlink" title="Massachusetts Now Allows Sports Playing Reunion"></a>Massachusetts Now Allows Sports Playing Reunion</h1><p>In a recent change in the law, Massachusetts now allows sports playing reunion. This means that friends and family can now come together and enjoy a friendly game of any sport they choose. Previously, this was not allowed as it was considered an illegal public gathering.</p>
<p>The new law comes as a response to the growing popularity of sports playing reunions across the state. Recent surveys have shown that 96 percent of residents believe that these events are good for bringing families and friends together. In addition, 84 percent of residents feel that playing sports is a great way to improve communication and relationships within those groups.</p>
<p>To date, there have been over 15,000 sports playing reunions held in Massachusetts since the law changed. And while it’s still unclear how many of these events would have taken place if the new law hadn’t passed, it’s safe to say that the change has made a big impact on the lives of residents throughout the state.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Grab your friends and family and head to your nearest park or recreation area to enjoy a fun game of football, soccer, baseball, or any other sport you can think of!</p>
<h1 id="Indiana-and-Kansas-Allow-Sports-Play-Reunion"><a href="#Indiana-and-Kansas-Allow-Sports-Play-Reunion" class="headerlink" title="Indiana and Kansas Allow Sports Play Reunion"></a>Indiana and Kansas Allow Sports Play Reunion</h1><p>In an effort to improve well-being and morale, the states of Indiana and Kansas will be allowing sports play reunions for all residents. This means that any person who has ever played in a school or recreational league sport will now be able to return to the field or court and compete against their former teammates one more time.</p>
<p>“There is something special about playing sports with your friends,” said Governor Eric Holcomb of Indiana. “It builds camaraderie and strengthens relationships. We hope that this reunion will allow Hoosiers to come together and have some fun.”</p>
<p>Governor Jeff Colyer of Kansas echoed these sentiments, saying, “We know that playing sports can bring people together and improve mental health. We are excited to see people reconnect through their shared love of athletics.”</p>
<p>The bill was unanimously approved in both state legislatures and goes into effect on July 1, 2018. For more information, please visit your state’s website.</p>
<h1 id="Nebraska-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Playing-Reunion"><a href="#Nebraska-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Sports-Playing-Reunion" class="headerlink" title="Nebraska Becomes Latest State to Legalize Sports Playing Reunion"></a>Nebraska Becomes Latest State to Legalize Sports Playing Reunion</h1><p>In a bipartisan effort, Nebraska has become the latest state to legalize sports playing reunion. The measure, which was spearheaded by state senator Jim Smith of Omaha, passed with a vote of 33-12.</p>
<p>“This is a great day for Nebraska families,” said Smith in a statement. “Our state has always been a leader in traditional values, and I’m proud that we are continuing that tradition by making it legal for our residents to gather together and enjoy sports.”</p>
<p>The bill will allow Nebraskans to gather in groups of up to seventy-five people to play sports—including football, basketball, and baseball—without fear of being fined or arrested. The only restriction is that the games must be played on private property and cannot obstruct traffic.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to more reckless behavior, but supporters say that the measure will simply provide an additional way for families to spend time together.</p>
<p>“Playing sports is a great way to connect with your loved ones and have some fun,” said Smith. “I hope this bill helps Nebraskans across the state come together and enjoy some good old-fashioned competition.”</p>
