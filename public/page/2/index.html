The heartfelt lyrics and beautiful melody make it a natural choice for casinos and other places where people want to feel relaxed and romantic.</p>
<p>While these two songs are definite contenders for the title of most popular tune played at the Lotus Casino, there are many other songs that could be included on this list.

But unbeknown to most, there is another tourist spot that is just a few hours away from the country’s capital - Manila. This place is called Casino!</p>
<p>Casino was first opened in 1969 as a recreational area for American military personnel stationed in the Philippines. The airfield and naval base were abandoned after the U.S. forces withdrew in 1991, which left the town with little economic activity.</p>
<p>That all changed in 2004 when businessman Dennis Uy entered into an agreement with the municipal government of Casino to rehabilitate the area and turned it into a resort and casino known as Resort World Manila.</p>
<p>The new resort complex was an instant success, drawing both locals and foreigners alike with its world-class hotel accommodations, restaurants, shopping arcade, and of course, its casino gaming facilities.</p>
<p>Today, Resort World Manila remains one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, thanks in part to its history as Casino - the forgotten town that rose again to become one of Asia’s top gaming destinations.</p>
<h1 id="The-Legacy-of-Casino-What-Once-Was-and-What-Could-Have-Been"><a href="#The-Legacy-of-Casino-What-Once-Was-and-What-Could-Have-Been" class="headerlink" title="The Legacy of Casino: What Once Was and What Could Have Been"></a>The Legacy of Casino: What Once Was and What Could Have Been</h1><p>The city of Casino was founded in the early 1800s as a mining town. The narrow-gauge railway running through the area helped to spur its growth, and by the late 1800s it had become a thriving community.</p>
<p>Casino’s fortunes changed in the early 1900s with the discovery of gold in Alaska. Many of the town’s residents moved north, and Casino entered into a period of decline.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, however, it was discovered that Casino sat atop one of North America’s largest reserves of lead and zinc. This led to a renewed interest in the town, and its population began to grow once again.</p>
<p>Today, Casino is a thriving community with a population of over 10,000 people. It is home to a number of businesses, including several mining companies. The legacy of Casino is one of boom and bust, but its residents are determined to make it thrive once again.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-The-Forgotten-Resort-of-the-Strip"><a href="#Casino-The-Forgotten-Resort-of-the-Strip" class="headerlink" title="Casino: The Forgotten Resort of the Strip"></a>Casino: The Forgotten Resort of the Strip</h1><p>Casinos used to be the lifeblood of the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p>They were the resorts that people would flock to in order to try their luck at some of the most impressive gaming floors in the world.</p>
<p>But in recent years, casinos have taken a backseat to other types of resorts, namely mega-resorts and boutique hotels.</p>
<p>In this article, we’re going to take a look at what happened to the casino industry in Las Vegas and why it has fallen out of favour.</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of Casino Resorts</p>
<p>The casino industry in Las Vegas had its heyday in the 1990s and early 2000s. Back then, there were more than 40 casinos on the Strip and they were collectively bringing in billions of dollars in revenue each year.</p>
<p>But over time, things changed. The recession hit Las Vegas hard and caused many people to lose their jobs – including those who worked in the casino industry. At the same time, new resorts started popping up all over the Strip, which drew away customers from the older casinos.</p>
<p>Today, there are only about 25 casinos on the Strip and they’re collectively generating much less revenue than they used to. In fact, casino revenue has declined by more than 50% since its peak in 2007.</p>
<p>What Happened to Casino Employment?</p>
<p>The decline in casino revenue has had a significant impact on employment in the industry. In 2007, there were more than 170,000 people working in casinos in Las Vegas. But today, that number has shrunk to just over 80,000 – a decline of more than 50%.</p>
<p>So what happened to all those jobs? A lot of them were lost during the recession and they haven’t come back since. In fact, many casinos are now hiring fewer workers than they did before the recession hit.</p>
<p>Why Casinos are No Longer popular Resorts</p>
<p>  So why aren’t casinos as popular as they used to be? There are a few reasons:  1) The Recession: The recession hit Las Vegas hard and caused many people to lose their jobs – including those who worked in the casino industry. At the same time, new resorts started popping up all over the Strip, which drew away customers from the older casinos. 2) Competition from Other Types of Resorts: Casinos have been losing market share to other types of resorts, namely mega-resorts and boutique hotels . 3) The Advent of Online Gambling: The advent of online gambling has also taken away some business from traditional casinos . In short, there are a few factors that have contributed to the decline of casino resorts in Las Vegas:  • The recession caused many people to lose their jobs – including those who worked in casinos • New resorts popped up all over Strip that drew away customers • Online gambling took away some business from traditional casinos</p>
<h1 id="Memories-of-Casino-A-Time-When-Gaming-was-Truly-a-Family-Affair"><a href="#Memories-of-Casino-A-Time-When-Gaming-was-Truly-a-Family-Affair" class="headerlink" title="Memories of Casino: A Time When Gaming was Truly a Family Affair"></a>Memories of Casino: A Time When Gaming was Truly a Family Affair</h1><p>For some, the mention of casino conjures up images of slick and suave individuals gathered around tables in smoky rooms, engaging in high-stakes games. These days, casinos are often seen as a place for those looking to gamble and have some fun. However, things were not always so. Casinos used to be a family affair.</p>
<p>When casinos were first introduced, they were meant for the elite members of society. The general public was not allowed to participate in the games. It was only later on that casinos began to open their doors to the average person. Even then, it was mostly men who frequented these places. Women were often not allowed inside and if they were, they were usually relegated to a separate section of the casino. This changed over time as society evolved and women began to demand more equality.</p>
<p>Gaming has always been a popular pastime for families. There is something about gambling that brings people together and creates a sense of camaraderie. Many families fondly remember spending time at the casino together and enjoying each other’s company while playing games like blackjack and roulette. In fact, some families even consider casino visits to be a special occasion.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that gaming has come a long way since its inception. Today, there are all sorts of different games available for people to play and the industry is constantly evolving. However, it is important to remember the origins of gaming and the role that families have played in its evolution. Casino will always hold a special place in our hearts for reminding us of those times when gaming was truly a family affair</p>
<h1 id="The-End-of-an-Era-Casino-Closes-Its-Doors-for-the-Last-Time"><a href="#The-End-of-an-Era-Casino-Closes-Its-Doors-for-the-Last-Time" class="headerlink" title="The End of an Era: Casino Closes Its Doors for the Last Time"></a>The End of an Era: Casino Closes Its Doors for the Last Time</h1><p>In a move that has sent shockwaves through the community, the local casino announced it would be closing its doors for the last time at the end of the month.</p>
<p>The closure has left many people wondering what will happen to them now that their main form of entertainment is gone. Some are worried about how they will make ends meet, others are concerned about what this will mean for the economy as a whole.</p>
<p> Local officials have been quick to downplay the impact of the closure, insisting that there are plenty of other things to do in the area. They have promised to do everything they can to help those who are affected by the closure.</p>
<p>The casino has been a fixture in the community for years, and its closure is sure to leave a hole in many people’s lives. We can only hope that those affected can come to terms with this turn of events and find ways to move on.</p>

The casino is one of the largest in California and is a popular destination for both tourists and locals.</p>
<p>Murdoch has long been interested in the gambling industry, and he already owns several casinos in the United States. This latest acquisition will give him a commanding presence in the California market.</p>
<p>News Corp hailed the deal as a major victory, and they said that it would help them to further expand their business in the United States. In a statement, Murdoch said that he was looking forward to working with the team at Fantasy Springs Casino to create “a world-class gambling destination.”</p>
<p>The sale still needs to be approved by regulators, but it is expected to go through without any problems. Once it is finalized, Fantasy Springs Casino will become part of Murdoch’s sprawling media empire.</p>

The resort is planning a multimillion-dollar renovation to coincide with the new name.</p>
<p>“With our renovation, we want to transport guests to a luxurious palace that pays homage to classic Hollywood,” said Fantasy Springs Resort Casino General Manager David Dominguez in a statement. “Rupert’s Palace will be a true destination for those who crave the finer things in life.”</p>
<p>The renovations will include updates to the guest rooms, restaurants, and casino floor. The resort is also adding a new bar and lounge called The Gatsby, which will feature live entertainment and Champagne cocktails.</p>
<p>The casino has not yet released information about when the renovations will begin or how long they will last.</p>

The casino was purchased by the family in 2013 for $410 million and has been sold to a group of investors for $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The Murdochs will net a profit of $790 million on the sale, making it one of the most lucrative deals in the family’s history. The investment group that bought the casino includes members of the Perenchio family, which is headed by former Univision CEO A. Jerrold Perenchio.</p>
<p>The sale price set a new record for casinos in California and is even higher than what was paid for the Sands Casino Resort in Las Vegas. The new owners say they plan to invest an additional $100 million into Fantasy Springs to upgrade it and make it one of the premier casinos in southern California.</p>
<p>The Murdochs have been active in the casino business for many years, having also owned casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey and Foxwoods, Connecticut.</p>
<h1 id="Fantasy-Springs-Sold-to-Rupert-Murdoch-for-a-Song"><a href="#Fantasy-Springs-Sold-to-Rupert-Murdoch-for-a-Song" class="headerlink" title="Fantasy Springs Sold to Rupert Murdoch for a Song"></a>Fantasy Springs Sold to Rupert Murdoch for a Song</h1><p>Reports surfaced this morning that Rupert Murdoch has agreed to purchase Fantasy Springs Resort Casino in Indio, California for $425 million.</p>
<p>Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox will own the casino and its 2,000-acre grounds, which include a luxury hotel, spa and golf course.</p>
<p>The transaction is still subject to approval by the California Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>Fantasy Springs Resort Casino first opened in 1986 and features 86 gaming tables and 2,000 slot machines. It is one of the largest casinos in California.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Mogul-Buys-Fantasy-Springs-Plans-Major-Renovations"><a href="#Casino-Mogul-Buys-Fantasy-Springs-Plans-Major-Renovations" class="headerlink" title="Casino Mogul Buys Fantasy Springs, Plans Major Renovations"></a>Casino Mogul Buys Fantasy Springs, Plans Major Renovations</h1><p>The recent purchase of Fantasy Springs Resort Casino by casino mogul Steve Wynn has raised a few eyebrows in the Inland Empire. Wynn, who is most well-known for his ownership of the Mirage and the Bellagio in Las Vegas, has big plans for Fantasy Springs.</p>
<p>According to Wynn, the casino will see a major renovation that will include a new hotel tower, more than 1,000 new slot machines and table games, a new spa, and a variety of restaurants. The resort will also undergo a name change to Wynn Palace Coachella Valley.</p>
<p>“This is an exciting time for Fantasy Springs Resort Casino,” said Wynne in a statement. “We are going to invest more than $100 million into this property and create something truly special here in the Coachella Valley.”</p>
<p>The renovations are set to begin this fall and are expected to be completed by early 2018. In the meantime, Fantasy Springs remains open for business with all of its usual activities and amenities.</p>

        <h1 id="Meadows-Casino-to-Start-Cashless-Check-In-Process"><a href="#Meadows-Casino-to-Start-Cashless-Check-In-Process" class="headerlink" title="Meadows Casino to Start Cashless Check-In Process"></a>Meadows Casino to Start Cashless Check-In Process</h1><p>In a move to further improve the customer experience, Meadows Casino will soon start using a cashless check-in process. This means that customers will not need to use cash when checking in, but can instead use their credit or debit cards.</p>
<p>This new system is already being used in other casinos around the country, and Meadows Casino decided to adopt it in order to stay competitive. It will also provide a more convenient experience for players, as they will not have to worry about carrying around any cash.</p>
<p>The casino has not announced an exact start date for the new system, but it is expected to go into effect sometime in the near future. In the meantime, players can visit the Meadows Casino website for more information on how the new system will work.</p>
<h1 id="Meadows-Casino-to-Allow-Players-to-Use-Checks"><a href="#Meadows-Casino-to-Allow-Players-to-Use-Checks" class="headerlink" title="Meadows Casino to Allow Players to Use Checks"></a>Meadows Casino to Allow Players to Use Checks</h1><p>The Meadows Casino in Washington, Pennsylvania, is now allowing its customers to use checks as a form of payment. This comes after the casino eliminated its use of slot machines this past summer.</p>
<p>The casino made the decision to allow check payments after seeing a rise in the number of people using debit and credit cards. The Meadows Casino joins three other casinos in the state that also allow check payments: Rivers Casino, Presque Isle Downs &amp; Casino, and Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania has been experiencing an overall decline in casino revenue in recent years. The main reason for this has been the growth of online gambling, which offers players the opportunity to gamble from the comfort of their homes. In an effort to combat this trend, Pennsylvania casinos have been looking for ways to make their establishments more attractive to players.</p>
<p>Allowing customers to pay with checks is one way that casinos can do this. Other methods include adding dining and entertainment options, as well as increasing the number of slot machines and table games.</p>
<h1 id="Meadows-Casino-to-Stop-Accepting-Personal-Checks"><a href="#Meadows-Casino-to-Stop-Accepting-Personal-Checks" class="headerlink" title="Meadows Casino to Stop Accepting Personal Checks"></a>Meadows Casino to Stop Accepting Personal Checks</h1><p>Meadows Casino is no longer accepting personal checks as a form of payment. The casino announced the change on their website, citing “a need to provide our guests with additional and more convenient methods of payment.”</p>
<p>Meadows Casino is not the only establishment to stop accepting personal checks. A quick Google search reveals that a number of businesses, both small and large, have made the switch to alternative methods of payment.</p>
<p>So why are personal checks falling out of favor? There are a few reasons.</p>
<p>The first reason is that personal checks are slow. It can take up to two weeks for a check to clear, which is too long for many businesses.</p>
<p>Another reason is that personal checks can be easily forged. This has led to an increase in check fraud in recent years.</p>
<p>Finally, there are increasing fees associated with personal checks. Banks often charge a processing fee for cashing a personal check, and merchants may also charge a fee for accepting them. This can add up quickly, making other forms of payment more appealing.</p>
<p>So what are some of the alternative forms of payment that businesses are switching to?</p>
<p>One popular option is electronic payments such as PayPal or Apple Pay. These payments are quick and relatively secure, making them a popular choice for businesses.</p>
<p>Another option is debit cards. Debit cards are linked directly with a checking account, so they are quick and easy to use. They also offer protection against fraud, which can be valuable for businesses.</p>
<p>Credit cards are another option that businesses are increasingly using. Credit cards offer protections against fraud, and they can also help business owners build their credit history. Additionally, credit card companies often offer rewards programs that can be beneficial for businesses.</p>
<h1 id="Meadows-Casino-to-Implement-New-Check-In-Procedure"><a href="#Meadows-Casino-to-Implement-New-Check-In-Procedure" class="headerlink" title="Meadows Casino to Implement New Check-In Procedure"></a>Meadows Casino to Implement New Check-In Procedure</h1><p>Meadows Casino is set to roll out a new check-in procedure that will require all guests to provide a government-issued photo ID.</p>
<p>Starting on March 1, 2019, all guests must show a valid, non-expired ID in order to be checked in. Acceptable forms of identification include driver’s licenses, passports, and military IDs.</p>
<p>The new policy is being put into place as part of an effort to enhance security at the casino. All guests will be screened against various databases including the National Sex Offender Registry.</p>
<p>“The safety and security of our guests is our top priority,” said Meadows Casino spokesperson Dani D’Amico. “This new policy will help us keep our property safe and secure for everyone who visits.”</p>
<p>Guests who do not have a valid ID will not be allowed into the casino. They will be offered the opportunity to leave their belongings at the front desk and exit the property.</p>
<p>Meadows Casino is not the only property implementing this type of policy. Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts also require government-issued IDs for check-in.</p>
<h1 id="New-Meadows-Casino-Will-Require-Players-to-Use-Checks"><a href="#New-Meadows-Casino-Will-Require-Players-to-Use-Checks" class="headerlink" title="New Meadows Casino Will Require Players to Use Checks"></a>New Meadows Casino Will Require Players to Use Checks</h1><p>The new Meadows Casino will soon be opening in western Pennsylvania and require all players to use checks rather than cash. Owner and CEO of the casino, Robert Myers, said that this new rule is in place to help protect both the casino and its customers.</p>
<p>“It’s just a safety precaution,” said Myers. “We don’t want any of our customers walking around with a lot of cash on them.”</p>
<p>Myers also said that using checks instead of cash will make it easier for the casino to keep track of player winnings and losses.</p>
<p>While some players are unhappy with the new rule, most seem to be understanding.</p>
<p>“I’m not too thrilled about it, but I guess it’s better than nothing,” said one player.</p>
<p>The Meadows Casino is scheduled to open in late September.</p>

Not only do they know their way around a map, but they can also crunch numbers and beat the casinos at their own game.</p>
<p>In a study led by Dr. Christina Verschoor of the University of Cambridge, pigs were found to be more successful at casino games than in the farmyard. The study showed that pigs were able to identify patterns in randomness and make better choices when it came to gambling games like roulette. The findings challenge the long-held belief that animals are bad at dealing with randomness.</p>
<p>To test how well pigs could play casino games, the researchers placed them in front of a computer screen that displayed either a black or white dot. If the pig touched the dot that was the same colour as the one on the screen, it received a food reward. If it touched the wrong dot, it didn’t get a reward. Over time, the pigs learned to associate black dots with rewards and white dots with no rewards.</p>
<p>The researchers then played a modified version of roulette where instead of black and white dots, there were six different colours. Again, if the pig touched the dot that was the same colour as the one on screen, it received a food reward. This time however, there was also a random element - sometimes touching the correct dot did not result in a reward.</p>
<p>The pigs quickly learned which colours were associated with rewards, and even managed to win more money playing this game than they would have done playing roulette in a real casino!</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time pigs have been shown to be smarter than we give them credit for - earlier studies have shown that they can learn how to use tools and even play video games! So next time you see a pig out and about, don’t be so quick to write them off - they might just be beating you at your own game!</p>
<h1 id="Bankers-Get-Paid-to-Let-Pigs-Play"><a href="#Bankers-Get-Paid-to-Let-Pigs-Play" class="headerlink" title="Bankers Get Paid to Let Pigs Play"></a>Bankers Get Paid to Let Pigs Play</h1><p>In the small town of <town name>, there is a big problem. The local bank has been bought by a large, national bank. The new owners have decided that the town is not worth the effort and have closed it down.</p>
<p>The people of the town are in an uproar. How will they survive without a bank? The answer is, they won’t. At least, not very well.</p>
<p>The people of the town need to find a way to convince the new owners of the bank to reopen it. They could protest or write letters, but those might not be enough.</p>
<p>What the town needs is someone with connections to the new owners. Someone who can talk to them and explain how important it is for the town to have a bank.</p>
<p>That’s where the bankers comes in. Bankers get paid to let pigs play. And by that, I mean that they get paid to make connections and talk to people who can help their towns or businesses succeed.</p>
<p>So, what can the people of <town name> do? They can call their local banker and ask for help. The banker may not be able to reopen the bank himself, but he can certainly put in a good word for the town with his contacts at the national bank.</p>
<h1 id="Raid-the-Piggy-Bank-Game-Pays-Out-Big"><a href="#Raid-the-Piggy-Bank-Game-Pays-Out-Big" class="headerlink" title="Raid the Piggy Bank Game Pays Out Big"></a>Raid the Piggy Bank Game Pays Out Big</h1><p>Are you looking for a fun and exciting new game to play? Look no further than Raid the Piggy Bank. This game is sure to provide hours of entertainment and can potentially pay out big rewards.</p>
<p>Raid the Piggy Bank is a casino game that is based on the popular children’s game of feeding coins into a piggy bank until it breaks. In this game, you will be trying to break the bank by betting as many coins as possible on each spin. The more coins you bet, the bigger your potential rewards could be.</p>
<p>However, you need to be careful as there is also the risk of losing all of your hard-earned coins in one go. It is important to make sure that you only bet what you can afford to lose.</p>
<p>One thing that makes Raid the Piggy Bank so thrilling to play is that the reels are packed with high paying symbols. These include classic casino icons such as cherries, lemons, 7s and BARs. There is also a special golden coin symbol which pays out big rewards when it appears on the reels.</p>
<p>If you are feeling lucky, you can try your hand at the bonus game which is activated by landing three or more bonus symbols anywhere on the reels. In this game, you will need to pick one of four piggy banks in order to reveal a hidden prize. This could be anything from extra coins to even a jackpot worth thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>So why not give Raid the Piggy Bank a try today? With its exciting gameplay and potentially large payouts, you are sure to have a thrilling time playing this game.</p>
<h1 id="Watch-Out-for-Piggy-Banks-at-the-Casino"><a href="#Watch-Out-for-Piggy-Banks-at-the-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Watch Out for Piggy Banks at the Casino"></a>Watch Out for Piggy Banks at the Casino</h1><p>When you think of casinos, you probably think of high-stakes games and people winning or losing huge amounts of money. But casinos are not just for the wealthy – they’re also a great place to have a bit of fun and maybe win some money while you’re at it.</p>
<p>That said, if you’re going to gamble in a casino, it’s important to be smart about it. One thing you should watch out for is piggy banks. Piggy banks are small, coin-operated machines that dispense candy or small toys in exchange for coins. They’re usually found near the entrance or exit of the casino, and they can be a temptation for uninformed gamblers.</p>
<p>Piggy banks may seem like a harmless way to kill some time while you’re at the casino, but they can actually be very dangerous. That’s because piggy banks are designed to extract money from unsuspecting players. They do this by encouraging players to gamble more than they normally would.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say that you put $10 into a piggy bank. In order to get your money back, you would then need to put in another $10. This can tempt players into continuing to gamble even when they’re losing money, as they hope to break even or make a profit.</p>
<p>In addition, piggy banks often have misleading payout percentages printed on them. For example, a piggy bank might advertise that it has a payout percentage of 90%. However, this payout percentage is only calculated over the first few minutes of play. After that, the payout percentage drops significantly. So if you put $10 into the piggy bank and continue playing for an hour, your chances of getting anything back are very slim indeed.</p>
<p>So if you do decide to gamble in a casino, be sure to stay away from the piggy banks!</p>
<h1 id="Overspending-on-Gambling-No-Problem-With-Raid-the-Piggy-Bank"><a href="#Overspending-on-Gambling-No-Problem-With-Raid-the-Piggy-Bank" class="headerlink" title="Overspending on Gambling? No Problem With Raid the Piggy Bank"></a>Overspending on Gambling? No Problem With Raid the Piggy Bank</h1><p>If you are someone that has a tendency to overspend on gambling, there is no need to worry. You can simply raid your piggy bank for the money you need.</p>
<p>In fact, raiding your piggy bank may be a good idea even if you do not have a problem with overspending on gambling. This is because raiding your piggy bank can help you to build up your savings.</p>
<p>When it comes to raiding your piggy bank, there are a few things that you will want to keep in mind. For starters, make sure that you have an accurate estimate of how much money you have in the bank.</p>
<p>You also want to make sure that you only raid your piggy bank for as much money as you need. It is never a good idea to raid your savings account unnecessarily, as this can ruin your chances of building up your savings.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that raiding your piggy bank should only be a last resort. If there are other ways for you to get the money that you need, try those first.</p>
<p>If all else fails and you do need to raid your piggy bank, here are a few tips on how to do it effectively.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a plan</li>
</ol>
<p>Before raiding your piggy bank, it is important to make a plan. This means deciding how much money you will need and when you will need it by.</p>
<p>This will help ensure that you are not raiding your piggy bank unnecessarily and that you are only taking out as much money as you need. It will also help keep you organized and ensure that you stay on track financially.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Be realistic about what you can afford</li>
</ol>
<p>When raiding your piggy bank, it is important to be realistic about what you can afford. This means knowing what bills need to be paid and what expenses can be cut back on temporarily.</p>
<p>It also means being honest about the amount of money that you have saved in the bank. Do not raid your savings account if you do not have to – this will only set back your progress in building up your savings.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stay disciplined with how much money you take out<br>Quitting cold turkey when it comes to raiding your piggy bank can be difficult, especially if it is for something like gambling which can be addictive . However, if you take out too much money,you may end up finding yourself in the same position as before . Try taking out only enough money so thatyou knowyou can coveryour expenses without putting yourself into debt .4 . Create new goals for yourself Onceyou have raidedyourpiggybank , set new goalsto work towards soyou don’t find yourself in this situation again . Maybe save up for anew car or put away some extra money each month soyou don’t ever haveto raidyourpiggybankagain</li>
