        <h1 id="Sixers-Moving-on-from-Robert-Covington"><a href="#Sixers-Moving-on-from-Robert-Covington" class="headerlink" title="Sixers Moving on from Robert Covington"></a>Sixers Moving on from Robert Covington</h1><p>In a move that was somewhat surprising, the Philadelphia 76ers have decided to move on from Robert Covington. The 6’9″ forward has been a mainstay for the Sixers over the past few seasons, averaging 12.9 points and 5.4 rebounds per game last season. However, with Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris both joining the team this offseason, minutes were going to be tight for Covington and he ended up being the odd man out.</p>
<p>Covington was originally drafted by the Houston Rockets in 2013 but was traded to the Sixers on draft night. He had previously played college basketball at Tennessee State University. He came into his own with the Sixers in the 2016-17 season, when he averaged 14.8 points per game and shot 39% from three-point range. That season, he made his first All-Star appearance as a replacement for an injured player.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old Covington is a solid all-around player who can do a bit of everything on the court. He is an efficient scorer and rebounder, and is also a good defender who can lockdown opposing players. He will be missed by the Sixers, but they felt they had to make this move in order to create more playing time for their new stars.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see where Covington ends up next. He is sure to get plenty of interest from other teams around the league, and should be able to find a good home somewhere. He is clearly a very talented player and should continue to thrive in the NBA. Thanks for everything, Robert Covington – you will definitely be missed in Philly!</p>
<h1 id="Sixers-Add-Veteran-Power-Forward"><a href="#Sixers-Add-Veteran-Power-Forward" class="headerlink" title="Sixers Add Veteran Power Forward"></a>Sixers Add Veteran Power Forward</h1><p>The Philadelphia 76ers have agreed to a one-year deal with veteran power forward Amir Johnson, according to league sources.</p>
<p>Johnson, 31, spent the last two seasons with the Boston Celtics and averaged 6.5 points and 4.6 rebounds in 18 minutes per game last season. He provides valuable depth at the power forward position for the Sixers and gives them another veteran presence in the locker room.</p>
<p>“We are excited to add Amir to our team,” said Sixers general manager Bryan Colangelo. “He is a proven player in this league and gives us another frontcourt rotation player who can impact the game both offensively and defensively.”</p>
<p>Johnson is a strong rebounder and defender, which will be a welcomed addition to a Sixers team that finished near the bottom of the league in both categories last season. He is also a decent scorer and can hit open shots, which could come in handy if Philadelphia’s young big men struggle early on this season.</p>
<p>The signing of Johnson does not preclude the Sixers from making other moves before the start of the season, but it does give them some added depth up front. With Joel Embiid, Dario Saric, Ben Simmons, Robert Covington, JJ Redick and Johnson all in the fold, Philadelphia has one of the most talented young rosters in the NBA.</p>
<h1 id="Sixers-Looking-for-Depth-at-the-Wing"><a href="#Sixers-Looking-for-Depth-at-the-Wing" class="headerlink" title="Sixers Looking for Depth at the Wing"></a>Sixers Looking for Depth at the Wing</h1><p>The Philadelphia 76ers are in the market for additional depth on the wing, preferably a player who can shoot from outside.</p>
<p>The Sixers have one of the best young big man duos in the league in Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, but they are lacking firepower on the wings. JJ Redick is a good shooter, but he is more of a tertiary option on offense.</p>
<p>Additional shooting help is needed if the Sixers want to make a deep playoff run.</p>
<p>Some of the players that Philly could target include Trevor Ariza, Corey Brewer, Mario Chalmers, and Lance Stephenson.</p>
<p>Ariza is the most accomplished player of the bunch and would bring playoff experience to the team. He shot over 38 percent from three-point range last season and would be a valuable asset off the bench.</p>
<p>Brewer is also a good three-point shooter and provides some much-needed athleticism on the wing. He won a championship with the Golden State Warriors in 2017 and knows what it takes to win.</p>
<p>Chalmers is coming off of an injury but is a proven scorer and defender when healthy. He would provide depth at both guard positions.</p>
<p>Stephenson is an enigma, but he can be a effective scorer when he’s focused. He shot over 36 percent from three last season and could be worth taking a chance on given his upside.</p>
<h1 id="76ers-acquire-Tyreke-Evans-from-the-Grizzlies"><a href="#76ers-acquire-Tyreke-Evans-from-the-Grizzlies" class="headerlink" title="76ers acquire Tyreke Evans from the Grizzlies"></a>76ers acquire Tyreke Evans from the Grizzlies</h1><p>The Philadelphia 76ers announced on Wednesday that they have acquired Tyreke Evans from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for Markelle Fultz.</p>
<p>The move comes as a bit of a surprise, as Evans is set to become a free agent this summer and the Grizzlies were not expected to be sellers at the trade deadline.</p>
<p>Evans, 28, is averaging 19.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 5.1 assists in 36 games this season. He was drafted fourth overall by the Sacramento Kings in 2009 and has since played for the New Orleans Pelicans and Grizzlies.</p>
<p>For the Sixers, Evans provides another veteran scorer to help take some of the load off of Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. He should also be able to play both guard spots, giving Philadelphia some flexibility on offense.</p>
<p>The move also gives Memphis some future assets to work with. Fultz, 20, was the first overall pick in 2017 but has struggled with injuries and inconsistency during his brief NBA career thus far.</p>
<h1 id="76ers-acquire-Markelle-Fultz-from-the-Celtics"><a href="#76ers-acquire-Markelle-Fultz-from-the-Celtics" class="headerlink" title="76ers acquire Markelle Fultz from the Celtics"></a>76ers acquire Markelle Fultz from the Celtics</h1><p>The Philadelphia 76ers have acquired Markelle Fultz from the Boston Celtics in a multiplayer trade. Fultz, the 2017 number-one overall pick, joins a young Sixers squad that includes Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons.</p>
<p>In return for Fultz, the Celtics receive Jayson Tatum and a future first-round pick. “We are excited to add Markelle to our program,” said Sixers general manager Bryan Colangelo in a statement. “He is a unique talent with the potential to become an elite player in this league.”</p>
<p>A Washington native, Fultz averaged 23.2 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game during his lone season at Washington University. He was widely considered the top prospect in this year’s draft before injuring his ankle in March.</p>
<p>Despite the injury, the Sixers were still eager to acquire Fultz, who they believe can be a star player alongside Simmons and Embiid. “There is no question that Markelle has tremendous upside,” said Colangelo. “He has the talent and instincts to be one of the NBA’s best players.”</p>
