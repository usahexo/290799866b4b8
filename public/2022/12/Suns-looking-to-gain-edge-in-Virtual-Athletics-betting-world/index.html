        <h1 id="Suns-looking-to-gain-edge-in-Virtual-Athletics-betting-world"><a href="#Suns-looking-to-gain-edge-in-Virtual-Athletics-betting-world" class="headerlink" title="Suns looking to gain edge in Virtual Athletics betting world"></a>Suns looking to gain edge in Virtual Athletics betting world</h1><p>The Phoenix Suns have been on the lookout for an edge in the Virtual Athletics betting world, and with the help of blockchain technology they may have found it.</p>
<p>The Suns announced yesterday that they have partnered with global gaming company Animoca Brands to develop a blockchain-based game for fans to bet on. The game, which is set to release in the fall, will allow fans to bet on matchups between professional NBA teams and their AI counterparts.</p>
<p>According to Suns’ president of basketball operations Lon Babby, the new game is a way to bring excitement and engagement to fans who are unable to attend games in person. “We are always looking for innovative ways to create unique fan experiences,” said Babby. “This new game will provide our fans with a fun and engaging way to interact with our team and players.”</p>
<p>The game will use Animoca’s own blockchain protocol called TEPPEN, which was developed in partnership with leading Japanese telecoms company NTT Docomo. The platform will allow users to place bets using the native token of the platform, called TenXWO.</p>
<p>Animoca Brands CEO Yat Siu sees the partnership as an opportunity to tap into the growing global market for sports betting. “Sports betting is a massive global market, estimated at USD$1 trillion per year, and we believe that blockchain technology can provide significant benefits for both users and operators alike,” said Siu.</p>
<p>While there is no doubt that the Phoenix Suns stand to gain from this new venture, it is also a smart move by Animoca Brands. The company has seen success with its other blockchain-based games such as CryptoKitties, which has become one of the most popular games on Ethereum.</p>
<h1 id="Suns-turning-to-virtual-athletics-betting-to-improve-fortunes"><a href="#Suns-turning-to-virtual-athletics-betting-to-improve-fortunes" class="headerlink" title="Suns turning to virtual athletics betting to improve fortunes"></a>Suns turning to virtual athletics betting to improve fortunes</h1><p>The Phoenix Suns organization is in a state of disarray. They have not been to the playoffs since 2010 and their last winning season was in 2013. Their attendance numbers reflect this, as they rank near the bottom of the league in terms of fan turnout. Team owner Robert Sarver has been looking for ways to improve the team’s fortunes and he believes that virtual sports betting may hold the answer.</p>
<p>Sarver was in attendance at the recent Global Gaming Expo held in Las Vegas and he was reportedly very impressed with the new virtual sports betting products that are now available. These products allow fans to bet on simulated games using realistic graphics and accurate player stats. Sarver believes that this type of product can help to engage Suns fans and lure them back to Talking Stick Resort Arena.</p>
<p>The Suns organization has not announced any specific plans to offer virtual sports betting, but it is clear that they are eyeing this market closely. It will be interesting to see if they decide to enter into this market and if they are successful, it could pave the way for other teams in the NBA and other leagues to follow suit.</p>
<h1 id="How-does-virtual-athletics-betting-work-for-the-Phoenix-Suns"><a href="#How-does-virtual-athletics-betting-work-for-the-Phoenix-Suns" class="headerlink" title="How does virtual athletics betting work for the Phoenix Suns?"></a>How does virtual athletics betting work for the Phoenix Suns?</h1><p>The Phoenix Suns want to make it easier for their fans to place bets on games involving their favorite team. In response, they have announced they will allow bets to be placed on virtual athletics starting with the 2019-2020 season. This is how it will work.</p>
<p>Fans that want to place a bet on the Phoenix Suns will need to download an app that the team has developed. They can then use this app to place their bet on any game, whether it is in progress or not. The Suns will keep track of all the bets and update the odds accordingly.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions on what bets can be placed. For example, fans cannot bet on how many points a player will score or which team will win. However, they can bet on things such as whether there will be a tie or whether either team will reach a certain number of points.</p>
<p>The Suns believe that this new betting option will be popular with their fans. It is hoped that it will also increase interest in the sport and help to boost attendance at games.</p>
<h1 id="Virtual-Athletics-an-Untapped-Opportunity-for-Phoenix-Suns"><a href="#Virtual-Athletics-an-Untapped-Opportunity-for-Phoenix-Suns" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Athletics an Untapped Opportunity for Phoenix Suns"></a>Virtual Athletics an Untapped Opportunity for Phoenix Suns</h1><p>In the early days of professional sports, arena walls were used as a backdrop for boxers and wrestlers. It was also a place to display advertising and notices. In 1891, the first baseball game was played in a “ball park” that had wooden fences and no roof. The modern sports arena has its origins in the Chicago Stadium, which was built in 1929. It was there that fans first experienced the energy and excitement of watching athletes compete in an enclosed space.</p>
<p>Today, professional sports teams rely on their arenas to generate revenue through ticket sales, concessions, and sponsorships. Some teams are looking for new ways to generate revenue and tap into new markets. The Phoenix Suns are one such team. They are exploring the potential of virtual athletics to help them achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Virtual athletics is a new sport that combines competitive gaming with physical activity. Participants use virtual reality headsets to play games against one another. The games are designed to simulate traditional sports, such as basketball and football. Players can compete against others from around the world or against artificial intelligence (AI) opponents.</p>
<p>Virtual athletics is still in its early stages of development, but there is already evidence that it can be popular with fans. For example, the Championships Series for VR League – which is organized by Oculus Rift – attracted over 170,000 viewers online last year. This number is expected to grow in 2019 as more people become aware of virtual athletics.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Suns see potential in virtual athletics and are planning to invest in it accordingly. They have established a Virtual Athletics Division within their organization and appointed Aaron Greenberg as its head. Greenberg has over 20 years of experience in the video game industry and is excited about the opportunity to introduce virtual athletics to the Suns fans.</p>
<p>The Suns believe that virtual athletics has the potential to attract new fans, who may not traditionally follow professional sports teams. In addition, they believe that it can help them reach new markets, such as Asia and South America. Virtual athletics presents an opportunity for the Phoenix Suns to expand their brand and grow their business.</p>
<h1 id="Phoenix-Suns-Eyeing-Virtual-Athletics-Betting-Market"><a href="#Phoenix-Suns-Eyeing-Virtual-Athletics-Betting-Market" class="headerlink" title="Phoenix Suns Eyeing Virtual Athletics Betting Market"></a>Phoenix Suns Eyeing Virtual Athletics Betting Market</h1><p>When it comes to the National Basketball Association, no market is off limits for the Phoenix Suns organization. From developing young talent to exploring international opportunities, the Suns are always looking for new ways to improve their fortunes. This doggedness has now led them to the burgeoning virtual sports betting market.</p>
<p>Virtual sports have been around for a few years now, with early versions appearing as simple as slot machines with animated athletes. However, in recent years this nascent industry has exploded in popularity, with better graphics and more realistic game play. Major gaming companies like EA Sports and Konami have developed advanced virtual sports simulations that allow users to bet on a wide variety of outcomes.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this growth more apparent than in Asia, where bets on virtual sports can account for over 50% of total betting volume. In Europe, the market is also sizable, with over €2 billion wagered in 2016. The United States is still behind these regions, but is catching up quickly thanks to the increasing availability of online betting platforms.</p>
<p>Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver sees great potential in this market and believes his team can be a major player. “The global appetite for virtual sports betting is huge and growing rapidly,” Sarver said in a statement. “We believe the Phoenix Suns can become one of the leading teams in this space.”</p>
<p>The Suns have already started making moves to get involved in the virtual athletics betting market. They recently partnered withleading virtual sports provider Kambi Group to offer their products on the Suns’ official website. Kambi Group is one of the largest and most well-respected providers in the industry, with a portfolio of clients that includes many major European bookmakers.</p>
<p>“This partnership gives our fans who are interested in virtual sports another way to enjoy our team and our brand,” said Sarver. “It’s also an important step for us as we look to expand our presence into new markets.”</p>
<p>There is no doubt that virtual athletics betting is a booming industry, but will Phoenix Suns be able to make a dent? That remains to be seen, but they are certainly off to a good start.</p>
