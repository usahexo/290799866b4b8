#  How to Make a DIY Hemp Wick Holder for Your Warriors Poster

Making a DIY hemp wick holder is simple and can be done with materials that you may already have. This project is perfect for those who want to show their support for the warriors by displaying a poster or flag in their home or office. Follow these easy steps to make your very own hemp wick holder today:

To start, you will need a piece of wood that is at least 12 inches long and 2 inches wide. You can use a piece of scrap wood or find one at your local hardware store. If you are using a piece of scrap wood, you may need to cut it to size.

Next, you will need some sandpaper to sand down the edges of your wood piece. This will help prevent any injuries from happening if you decide to use the hemp wick holder as a weapon in case of an emergency.

Now it's time to stain or paint your wood piece. You can choose whatever color you like, but we recommend using a dark brown or black stain to match the look of a typical warriors poster or flag.

#  How Hemp Wick Can Keep Your Golden State Warriors Poster in Good Condition

If you're a fan of the Golden State Warriors, you probably have a few posters of your favorite players in your home. Watching your team dominate on the court is surely exciting, but if you're not careful, the excitement can lead to some damage to your posters. Thankfully, there's a simple solution that can help keep your poster in good condition: hemp wick.

What is Hemp Wick?

Hemp wick is made from the fibrous stalk of the hemp plant. The stalk is dried and then cut into thin strips, which are braided together to create the wick. The thinness of the hemp fiber allows it to easily light up and reach high temperatures.

Why Use Hemp Wick?

There are a few reasons why hemp wick is a great choice for protecting your Warriors posters. First, it's non-toxic. That means it won't release any harmful chemicals into the air when you're using it to light candles or cigarettes. Second, it's biodegradable. When you're done with it, you can safely toss it in the trash without having to worry about harming the environment. Third, it's flame retardant. Hemp wick will extinguish itself once it goes out, so you don't have to worry about starting a fire.

How to Use Hemp Wick

Using hemp wick is simple: just light one end and let it burn for a few seconds until the flame is established. Then, hold the lit end near whatever you're trying to light and enjoy! When you're done using it, simply blow out the flame and put the wick away until next time.
