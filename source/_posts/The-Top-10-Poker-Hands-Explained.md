#  The Top 10 Poker Hands Explained

In poker, the strength of your hand is ranked according to a standard hierarchy. This ranking system is used to determine who wins in the event of a tie. The hands are listed from strongest to weakest.

#1: Royal flush
A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker and consists of 5 consecutive cards of the same suit, starting with an ace. If two players have a royal flush, then the player with the highest card within the royal flush wins. For example, if one player has an ace and the other has a king, then the player with the ace would win.

#2: Straight flush
A straight flush is 5 consecutive cards of the same suit, but not all of them need to be sequential (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). If two players have a straight flush, then the player with the highest-ranked card within the straight flush wins. So if one player has an Ace-King-Queen-Jack-Ten (high card Ace) and another player has an Ace-Two-Three-Four-Five (high card Two), then the first player would win since their Ace is higher than Two.

#3: Four of a kind
Four of a kind consists of 4 cards of the same rank and one random card. So for example 4 sixes and 2 eights would make a four of a kind. If two players have four of a kind then the rank of the four cards determines who wins - so for example two Aces and two Kings would beat two Deuces and two Sixes.

#4: Full house 
A full house is three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank (e.g. 3 kings and 2 queens). If two players have a full house then the rank of the three cards determines who wins - so for example 3 Queens and 2 Kings would beat 3 Jacks and 2 Aces. 

#5: Flush 
A flush is five cards all of which are from the same suit but not necessarily in sequence (e.g. club 9, heart 10, diamond jack). If two players have a flush then whoever has the highest card in their flush will win - so for example if one player has 9 clubs as their highest card and another has 10 hearts as their highest card then that person with 10 Hearts will win! 
If both players have equal high cards then whoever has more suits will win - for example both players may have clubs as their high suit however if Player 1 also has diamonds as their high suit while Player 2 only has clubs then Player 1 will win as they have more suits overall! 

#6: Straight 
A straight is five consecutive cards but not all in sequence (e.g. club 2, heart 3, spades 4, club 5) If two players have a straight then whoever has the highest card within that straight will win - so for example Ace-King-Queen-Jack-Ten would beat Two-Three-Four-Five-Six!
