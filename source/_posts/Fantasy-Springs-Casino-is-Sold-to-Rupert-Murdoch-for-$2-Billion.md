#  Fantasy Springs Casino is Sold to Rupert Murdoch for $2 Billion

It was announced on Wednesday that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp had agreed to purchase Fantasy Springs Casino in Indio, California for $2 billion. The casino is one of the largest in California and is a popular destination for both tourists and locals.

Murdoch has long been interested in the gambling industry, and he already owns several casinos in the United States. This latest acquisition will give him a commanding presence in the California market.

News Corp hailed the deal as a major victory, and they said that it would help them to further expand their business in the United States. In a statement, Murdoch said that he was looking forward to working with the team at Fantasy Springs Casino to create "a world-class gambling destination."

The sale still needs to be approved by regulators, but it is expected to go through without any problems. Once it is finalized, Fantasy Springs Casino will become part of Murdoch's sprawling media empire.

"With our renovation, we want to transport guests to a luxurious palace that pays homage to classic Hollywood," said Fantasy Springs Resort Casino General Manager David Dominguez in a statement. "Rupert's Palace will be a true destination for those who crave the finer things in life."

#  Murdochs Make Huge Profit in Sale of Fantasy Springs Casino

The Murdoch family, led by patriarch Rupert Murdoch, has made a handsome profit on the sale of the Fantasy Springs Casino in southern California. The casino was purchased by the family in 2013 for $410 million and has been sold to a group of investors for $1.2 billion.

The Murdochs will net a profit of $790 million on the sale, making it one of the most lucrative deals in the family's history. The investment group that bought the casino includes members of the Perenchio family, which is headed by former Univision CEO A. Jerrold Perenchio.

The sale price set a new record for casinos in California and is even higher than what was paid for the Sands Casino Resort in Las Vegas. The new owners say they plan to invest an additional $100 million into Fantasy Springs to upgrade it and make it one of the premier casinos in southern California.

The Murdochs have been active in the casino business for many years, having also owned casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey and Foxwoods, Connecticut.
