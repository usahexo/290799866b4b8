#  Author Michael Crichton Advises Casino Patrons to Turn Off Slot Machines When Not in Use

Las Vegas, Nevada - Renowned science fiction writer and screenwriter, Michael Crichton, has come out against slot machines in casinos, advising casino-goers to turn the machines off when they're not playing.

Crichton says that slot machines are "a tax on the stupid," insisting that the vast majority of people who play them lose money. He urges people to take a break from the machines, even if it's only for a few minutes, in order to avoid losing more money than they intended to.

Crichton is no stranger to gambling; he has written about it extensively in his books and screenplays. But he says that he's never been interested in slot machines, which he believes are designed specifically to extract as much money from customers as possible.

Slot machine manufacturers and casino operators have dismissed Crichton's comments as uninformed and misguided. They argue that slot machines are a fun form of entertainment that can be profitable for players who know how to use them correctly.

But Crichton is sticking by his guns, saying that turning off the machines when you're not playing is the best way to protect yourself from their addictive power.

#  Nevada Gaming Officials Urge Players to Shut Down Slot Machines When Not in Use

RENO, Nev. – The Nevada Gaming Commission is urging casino-goers to remember to shut down slot machines when they’re not using them to avoid any unnecessary losses.

Chairman Tony Alamo Jr. said in a statement that the commission has been made aware of cases where players have left slot machines running only to return later to find out that they had lost money.

“We would like to remind our patrons that it is important to properly shut down slot machines when you are not playing them,” said Alamo. “This will help protect your credits and ensure you don’t lose any money due to machine malfunction.”

#  Is It Better to Turn Off Slot Machines When You're Not Playing?

You've just hit a jackpot on a slot machine and you're feeling pretty good about yourself. You've managed to score a big win without having to risk too much money. You continue to play the machine, but your luck has run out and you eventually walk away with nothing. Is it better to turn off the machine when you're not playing?

There's no definitive answer, as it really depends on the individual player and the casino itself. However, some people believe that turning off the slot machines when you're not playing is the best way to ensure that you don't lose any money. This is because it prevents other players from playing the machine while you're not there, which could lead to them winning the jackpot that you had your eye on.

It's also important to consider whether or not your casino offers a player's card. This is a card that gives players access to rewards, such as free rooms, food, and drinks. Casinos generally offer better rewards for players who use their cards more often, so it might be worth your time to sign up for one if you don't have one already.

If you do opt to sign up for a player's card, make sure you read the terms and conditions before using it. Some cards come with restrictions, such as being unable to redeem rewards on certain days or during certain hours. It's also important to be aware of any black out dates that may apply. A black out date is a date on which rewards cannot be redeemed.

In general, casinos are designed to make money off of players. However, there are some things that players can do to improve their chances of winning and minimize their losses. Turning off slot machines when you're not playing is one way to do this, but it's ultimately up to each individual player to decide what works best for them.
