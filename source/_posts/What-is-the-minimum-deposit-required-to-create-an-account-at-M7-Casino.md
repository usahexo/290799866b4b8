#  What is the maximum amount that can be withdrawn from an account in a single transaction?

Most banks have a limit on the maximum amount that can be withdrawn from an account in a single transaction. For example, HSBC has a limit of £10,000.

This limit is usually set for security reasons, to help protect customers against fraud. It also means that if someone tries to withdraw a large sum of money from their account in one go, the bank can refuse to process the transaction.
